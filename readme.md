Plup (short for **Pl**ugin **up**dater) is a [Renoise][] tool that scans
the current song for **outdated or broken plugin devices** (track FX chains
and instrument plugins), finds the best installed candidate, and upgrades
them while trying to preserve the previous preset/state.

## What it does

1. **Inventory (read-only).** Walks every track device (skipping the mixer
   device at index 1) and every instrument plugin. For each plugin it
   records its location, `device_path`/`name`, whether the API can still
   read its fields (this directly answers the "are broken devices visible?"
   question), and the parsed family (vendor + base name, version
   preserved). For instruments whose plugin fails to load (so the live API
   exposes no path or name) the original identity is recovered from the
   song's `Song.xml` (see *Missing / broken plugins* below), so they can
   still be matched.
2. **Candidate matching.** Builds a lookup from Renoise's own resolved
   installed-plugin lists (`track.available_device_infos` and
   `instrument.plugin_properties.available_plugin_infos`). Groups by family
   (the version is kept, so Pro-Q 2 ≠ Pro-Q 3) and ranks by **CLAP > VST3 >
   VST > AU** and by version. Cross-format / cross-branding upgrades are
   allowed (e.g. an AU `FabFilter FF Pro-MB` can be replaced by a VST3
   `FabFilter Pro-MB`) as long as the base name and vendor match.
3. **Swap + state transfer (per device, pcall-guarded).** For each chosen
   device it inserts the new plugin at the same position, then transfers
   the old state: (a) if the formats match, transplant the old
   `active_preset_data` directly; (b) if the formats differ, load a
   same-named factory preset as a base and overlay the old plugin's
   captured parameter values (matched by name); (c) if no transfer method
   succeeds, keep the new plugin at default state — strictly better than a
   missing plugin. The device enabled/bypass flag is preserved.
      - **Automation is preserved.** Plugin automation (track-device and
        instrument) is carried across the replacement, matched by parameter
        name: track devices rebind their live automation objects onto the new
        device, and instrument plugins rebuild it from the captured point data.
        All of this is best-effort and fully `pcall`-guarded, so a failure
        never aborts the upgrade.
  - **Reaktor ensembles use a bundled donor + a MIDI loopback.** Reaktor keeps
    its whole patch (ensemble + snapshot) inside the opaque state chunk and
    exposes no usable program bank until that state is loaded, and Reaktor 6
    rejects Reaktor 5's chunk. A known-good Reaktor 6 Razor state is therefore
    bundled into the tool (`lib/up_donor_data.lua`, base64) and injected into
    each upgraded Reaktor instance, but only when the instance is actually
    loaded with the Razor ensemble; an instance holding another ensemble keeps
    its own state instead of being silently rewritten to Razor. That loads the
    ensemble, but Renoise's plugin API can only address the plugin's **first**
    snapshot bank, so the per-instance snapshot is selected over a MIDI loopback
    (see *Reaktor 6 MIDI setup* below): Plup sends Bank Select CCs to move
    Reaktor's bank and lets Renoise choose the program, confirming the hit by the
    snapshot name embedded in the serialized state. Without the loopback, Reaktor
    instances still get the ensemble but only first-bank snapshots resolve.
  - **Reaktor 6 MIDI setup (one-time).** Bank Select is unreachable from the
    plugin API, so Plup needs a MIDI loopback port:
    1. macOS: open **Audio MIDI Setup → Window → Show MIDI Studio**,
       double-click **IAC Driver** and tick **Device is online** (this creates
       `IAC Driver (Bus 1)`; any loopback port whose name contains `IAC` works).
    2. Renoise: **Edit → Preferences → MIDI**, enable that bus in the **Inputs**
       list.
    3. Run the upgrade. Plup points each upgraded Reaktor instrument's MIDI
       input at the loopback port automatically; nothing else needs wiring.
4. **Per-row UI + live refresh.** Shows a grid with the current plugin, a
   "Replace with" dropdown of candidates (auto-selecting the best upgrade),
   and a result column. The dialog watches the song and re-scans (reusing
   the cached candidate pool) when devices/tracks/instruments change,
   preserving your previous dropdown choices. **It never saves the song** —
   you inspect/undo, and Renoise's own undo stack covers the device swaps.

## Using it

- Open a song, then pick **Tools → Plup** (or the global key
  binding you can assign in the Keyboard preferences). The dialog opens and
  immediately scans, building the candidate list in the background
  ("gathering replacements" — the slow part, run concurrently with the song
  scan so rows appear at once).
- Each row shows the current plugin and a **Replace with** dropdown. By
  default the best candidate is pre-selected; set a row to **"Keep
  current"** to leave that device alone. The current device's active preset
  name is shown when available (for missing plugins it is recovered from
  `Song.xml`).
- Press **Upgrade** to swap the selected devices. While running the button
  becomes **Stop** (the swaps already performed are kept). Nothing is
  written to disk unless you save the song yourself.
- The status line reports progress, and a final summary counts results per
  status (e.g. `upgraded-with-parameters`, `upgraded-name-matched-preset`,
  `upgraded-parameter-synth`, `upgraded-default`, `up-to-date`,
  `skipped-transfer-rejected`, `skipped-no-candidate-broken`).

## Missing / broken plugins

- **Broken *instrument* plugins:** when a plugin fails to load,
   `plugin_device` is `nil`, so the live API exposes no path or name. The
   tool reads the song's own `.xrns` archive (a zip containing `Song.xml`,
   which records every plugin's identity, including missing ones) to recover
    the original display name, then matches and upgrades it. `Song.xml` is
    parsed by the pure-Lua tree parser in `lib/up_xml.lua`, a thin builder over
    the vendored [SLAXML][] engine (`lib/slaxml.lua`, MIT-licensed and committed
    directly into `lib/` because the LuaRocks rockspec is broken).
    `up_songxml.parse_instruments` walks it with `find_all(root,"Instrument")`,
    so `<InstrumentGroup>` nesting and attribute-bearing tags are handled
    structurally, never by fragile string matching. The preset name is recovered
    from the song's `ParameterChunk` (base64 CDATA in `Song.xml`) or the
    instrument name, so the replacement can load that preset from the installed
    plugin's own bank; if no preset matches, it loads at default state.
- **Broken *track* devices:** detected when `active_preset_data` raises an
  error; these are listed as broken and matched normally from their
  `device_path`/`name`.
- **Missing-plugin name matching** is best-effort and version-flexible: it
  normalizes names (stripping protocol/category tags, architecture markers,
  and unifying separators) and uses a token-subset comparison, so e.g.
  `Kick - Nicky Romero` can map to `Kick 2`.

## Limitations / things to verify in Renoise

- **Preset-name recovery** parses the old `active_preset_data` XML (live
  plugins) or the song's `ParameterChunk` CDATA in `Song.xml` (missing
  plugins) for a name; this is best-effort and plugin-dependent. When a preset
  name is found it is loaded from the replacement's own bank, but if nothing
  matches, state is generally not otherwise transferred for missing plugins.
- **State transplant verification** accepts the transplant unless it raises
  an error or yields an empty state; some plugins re-encode preset data, so
  always sanity-check upgraded devices by ear.
- **Cross-format upgrades** carry state via captured parameter values
  matched by name; parameters the new plugin doesn't expose (or that aren't
  automatable) are dropped.

## Testing

The pure logic that can be verified without a live Renoise session has a
dependency-free Lua test suite (`tests/run.lua`) and a CI workflow
(`.github/workflows/test.yml`) that installs Lua 5.1 (matching Renoise's
LuaJIT), compile-checks every source file, and runs the suite:

    lua5.1 tests/run.lua

- The suite installs a **strict metatable on `_G`**: reading an *undeclared
  global* (e.g. a bare `utf8`) errors out. Always `require` libraries rather
  than referencing them as bare globals, and run `luacheck lib/*.lua tests/run.lua`
  (LibDeflate is vendored and excluded) to keep the lint clean.

It covers plugin-name analysis, candidate matching (exact and
version/name-flexible — including `Kick - Nicky Romero` → `Kick 2`,
`Reaktor5` → `Reaktor6`, and `FabFilter FF Pro MB` → `FabFilter Pro-MB`),
preset-name extraction, `Song.xml` recovery (against a zipped fixture), and
the inventory scan wired to a mocked song. Swap/state-transfer behavior
that needs the Renoise runtime is still verified manually per the checklist
below.

## Installation

This folder *is* the tool bundle (named after the tool id,
`org.bitbear.Plup.xrnx`).

- **Easy:** drag the `org.bitbear.Plup.xrnx` folder into Renoise's
  Tools directory, then restart Renoise (or use *Renoise → Help → Show
  Preferences → Plugins* to locate the folder). Renoise auto-detects tool
  folders.
- **As a package:** zip the folder's contents into
  `org.bitbear.Plup.xrnx` (the `.xrnx` extension *is* a zip) and
  install it from Renoise's *Tools → Install* browser, or double-click it.

After install you'll find **Tools → Plup** in the main menu (and
a global key binding you can assign in the Keyboard preferences).

## Testing checklist (needs a live Renoise session)

- On a scratch song, include one plugin known to reject cross-version state
  (e.g. FabFilter Saturn 1 → 2) and one that accepts it, and confirm the
  pcall-guarded fallback chain behaves (direct transplant, then
  preset+param overlay, then default-state upgrade).
- Test against a **copy** of a real project (never the original) to confirm
  broken track devices are visible and repairable, that up-to-date devices
  are reported as `skipped-up-to-date`, and that a missing instrument is
  recovered from `Song.xml` and upgraded.
